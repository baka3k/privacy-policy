  <h1>Privacy Policy (Updated for NFC & eID Usage)</h1>

  <p>Baka team built the Applications as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Baka team at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

  <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use our Service.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong>
    All features operate locally on your device. No user information is shared with any external server or third party unless explicitly stated and consented to.
  </p>

  <p>By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We do not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>üì≤ Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may request access to certain sensitive permissions and data including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>NFC (Near Field Communication):</strong><br>
      Our application uses NFC to read data stored on the Vietnamese National ID card (CCCD c√≥ g·∫Øn chip).<br>
      This feature is used solely for identity verification purposes on-device.<br>
      <strong>No personal information</strong> from your ID is collected, transmitted, or stored on any server. All processing is handled locally on your device.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Camera & Microphone:</strong><br>
      Only used when explicitly required by app features (e.g., scanning QR codes or video calls). No recordings or data are collected or stored.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet Access:</strong><br>
      Required for app features such as content updates or server communication (not related to NFC usage). This does not transmit any user data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>We do not collect any data from these permissions. All actions occur locally, and no data ever leaves your device unless you explicitly decide to share it.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>üîê Sensitive Permission Disclosure</h2>
  <p>This app uses NFC hardware and access to interact with electronic ID cards (eID) issued by the Vietnamese government. This usage aligns with permitted use-cases such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On-device identity confirmation</li>
    <li>Allowing the user to view their own information for personal use</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not upload, track, or process any personal data from these actions. The entire flow stays 100% on the user's phone.</strong>
    NFC usage is clearly explained in-app, and users must manually initiate scanning.
  </p>

  <h2>üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>Our use of NFC and government-issued ID data complies with relevant privacy policies and legal regulations. We encourage users to review official eID data policies of their local government (e.g., Vietnam‚Äôs Ministry of Public Security).</p>

  <h2>üîÅ Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>The app does not retain any data.</strong> Once a scan is completed or the session ends, all temporary data in memory is discarded immediately. We do not write anything to persistent storage or send any data off-device.
  </p>
